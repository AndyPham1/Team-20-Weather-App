# Team 20 Weather App

This is a weather app built by team 20 (which includes me) in CS2212 from western university.

Our weather app is as the name suggests, a weather viewing program that allows a user to view the current weather in their current location.   
Other features included in this app is to allow multiple locations to be selected, a short term forecast and a long term forecast. 

Here is the video demonstration used for the course:
